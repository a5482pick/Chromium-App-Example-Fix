 Native messaging app example referenced at https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/chrome/common/extensions/docs/examples/api/nativeMessaging, 
 and located at https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/chrome/common/extensions/docs/examples/api/nativeMessaging installs properly for Linux (Mint)
 Google Chrome but not for Chromium.  This adjusted code is for installing the app on Linux Chromium only.  It has been tested for user-specific installation and should
 work for system-wide installation too.
 Note that this file should replace the orginal install_host.sh.  Installation is performed as ' bash ./install_host.sh ' from within the 'host' folder.
